    "longDescription": "Ads help support me, the developer behind HyteServe, and allow the platform to stay updated with new content, tools, and features for the Hytale community.<br><br>If you use an ad blocker, I kindly ask that you consider whitelisting HyteServe. Ads are currently the main way I can keep the project alive and continue serving Hytale fans around the world with the content they’re looking for.<br><br>The ad network I’ve partnered with is Adsterra, which made it possible to set up fast, lightweight ads without disrupting your experience. If you’re not a fan of ads, no worries — I promise they will never block content or get in the way of browsing.<br><br>I would never allow ads that negatively impact the user experience.",
