    "longDescription": "Ads help support me, the developer behind HyteServe, and allow the platform to stay updated with new content, tools, and features for the Hytale community.<br><br>If you use an ad blocker, I kindly ask that you consider whitelisting HyteServe. Ads are currently the main way I can keep the project alive and continue serving Hytale fans around the world with the content they’re looking for.<br><br>The ad network I’ve partnered with is Adsterra, which made it possible to set up fast, lightweight ads without disrupting your experience. If you’re not a fan of ads, no worries — I promise they will never block content or get in the way of browsing.<br><br>I would never allow ads that negatively impact the user experience.",

    "description": "We have implemented a patch to block malicious redirects from our ad provider.",
    "longDescription": "Maintaining a safe and seamless experience on HyteServe is my top priority. Recently, I noticed that some Adsterra ads were causing unauthorized redirects, taking users away from our site to external pages. I have officially deployed a patch to address this.<br><br>The update includes stricter filtering on the ad scripts and the implementation of 'sandbox' attributes where possible to prevent the ads from triggering window-level redirects. This ensures that while ads still support the site, they can no longer hijack your browsing session.<br><br>If you still encounter any strange behavior or unexpected pop-ups, please reach out so I can continue to refine the security of our ad implementation.",
