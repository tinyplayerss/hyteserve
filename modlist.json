    "longDescription": "Smelt any fuel source in the Campfire Bench and produce more charcoal than usual.<br><br>This mod is still in early development, so be aware that using certain fuel sources may behave differently than expected. For example:<br>- Sticks.<br>- Any wood log.<br>- Etc.<br><br>As a note: I had friends test this mod and it works. Since I do not own the Standard Edition of Hytale, I’m unable to live-code the mod in-game, so I used online resources during development. My goal is to eventually develop more mods directly from the game rather than relying on external tools.<br><br><b>Installation Guide:</b><br><br>1. Download the mod using the 'Download File' button provided on this page.<br><br>2. Locate your Hytale installation directory.<br><br>3. Open the UserData folder inside the Hytale directory. You should see a 'Mods' folder.<br><br>4. Drag and drop the extracted mod into the 'Mods' folder, then launch the game using the Hytale Launcher.<br><br>5. To enable the mod, go to your Worlds menu, right-click a world to edit it, and find the mod list under the world thumbnail. Check the box to enable the mod and save your changes.<br><br>6. Join the world where the mod is enabled, use your default Campfire, burn any fuel source, and you’ll see that using 2 fuel items produces 5 charcoal.",
